# Passport-Authentication

- This is a simple login system made using NodeJS and MongoDB.

- User can login/register using their email-id and password and access the dashboard.

- The password of the user hashes with a salt, using bcrypt which is a very hard to crack hashing type.

- This authentication system can be used directly in the complex projects.
